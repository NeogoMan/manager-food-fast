## üìã MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED

The following tests need to be performed manually to verify complete functionality:

### Test 1: Verify Migration in Firebase Console

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fast-food-manager-b1f54/firestore
2. Check `restaurants` collection:
   - [ ] Document `rest_default_001` exists
   - [ ] All fields are populated correctly
   - [ ] Plan is set to "basic"
   - [ ] Status is "active"

3. Check `users` collection (sample 2-3 documents):
   - [ ] All have `restaurantId: "rest_default_001"`
   - [ ] All have `isSuperAdmin: false`
   - [ ] No users without restaurantId

4. Check `orders` collection (sample 5-10 documents):
   - [ ] All have `restaurantId: "rest_default_001"`
   - [ ] Order data intact (items, customer, status)

5. Check `menu` collection:
   - [ ] All 3 items have `restaurantId: "rest_default_001"`
   - [ ] Menu data intact

6. Check `notifications` collection (sample a few):
   - [ ] All have `restaurantId: "rest_default_001"`

**Expected Result**: All collections have restaurantId field, no data corruption

       "username": "admin",
       "restaurantId": "rest_default_001",
       "isSuperAdmin": false
     }
     ```

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### Fixed Issues

**Issue 1: Firestore Permission Errors on Page Load** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Error**: "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors in console when pages loaded
- **Root Cause**: Frontend pages were querying Firestore before authentication context finished loading
- **Fix Applied** (commit 7f6f8cd): Added authentication guards to all pages:
  - `Orders.jsx` - Wait for user before subscribing to orders
  - `Users.jsx` - Wait for user before fetching users list
  - `Kitchen.jsx` - Wait for user before subscribing to kitchen orders
  - `Menu.jsx` - Wait for user before loading menu items
  - `Dashboard.jsx` - Wait for user before fetching dashboard data
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Testing**: Refresh the application at http://localhost:5174 and check browser console - no permission errors should appear
