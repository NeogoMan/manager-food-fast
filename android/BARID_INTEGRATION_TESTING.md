# Barid SDK Integration Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Integration Complete!

The Barid SDK has been successfully integrated into your Fast Food Manager Android app on the `feature/barid-sdk-integration` branch.

## üìÅ What Was Added

### New Files:
- `app/src/main/java/com/barid/sdk/BaridSDK.kt` - Main SDK file
- `app/src/main/java/com/barid/sdk/BaridMessagingService.kt` - FCM messaging service

### Modified Files:
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added Barid messaging service
- `app/src/main/java/com/fast/manger/food/FastFoodApp.kt` - Added SDK initialization
- `app/src/main/java/com/fast/manger/food/MainActivity.kt` - Added FCM token logging and campaign handling

## üéØ How It Works

### Two Notification Channels:
1. **Existing FCMService**: Handles order status notifications (unchanged)
2. **BaridMessagingService**: Handles marketing campaigns from Barid dashboard

Both services can coexist and work independently!

## üé® Customization Options

### **Change User ID** (Use Real Manager ID)

In `FastFoodApp.kt`, replace the device ID with actual manager ID:

```kotlin
private fun initializeBaridSDK() {
    // Get manager ID from your auth system
    val userId = getCurrentManagerId() // Your auth method

    BaridSDK.getInstance().initialize(this, userId)

    // Add more user attributes
    BaridSDK.getInstance().setAttributes(mapOf(
        "platform" to "android",
        "appType" to "restaurant_manager",
        "appVersion" to BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME,
        "restaurantId" to getRestaurantId(), // Add restaurant context
        "managerRole" to getManagerRole() // e.g., "owner", "admin"
    ))
}
```

### **Add User Attributes for Targeting**

You can add any custom attributes for campaign targeting:

```kotlin
BaridSDK.getInstance().setAttributes(mapOf(
    "subscriptionPlan" to "premium",
    "restaurantType" to "fastfood",
    "city" to "Casablanca",
    "country" to "Morocco"
))
```

Then create segments based on these attributes in the Barid dashboard!

## üìä Next Steps

### **1. Test Different Notification Types**

Try creating notifications with:
- Images (add `imageUrl` in message creation)
- Deep links (navigate to specific screens)
- Different priorities

### **2. Test User Segmentation**

Create segments like:
- "Premium Managers" (subscriptionPlan = premium)
- "Casablanca Restaurants" (city = Casablanca)
- Active managers (lastActive within 7 days)

### **3. Test Scheduling**

Try scheduling campaigns for:
- Specific date/time
- Recurring (daily, weekly)

### **4. Monitor Analytics**

Check the Barid dashboard analytics:
- Delivery rate
- Open rate
- Click rate

## üöÄ Production Deployment

When ready for production:

1. **Update User ID Logic**:
   - Use real manager IDs from authentication
   - Add proper error handling

2. **Remove Test Logs**:
   - Remove or disable FCM token logging in MainActivity
   - Keep only necessary production logs

3. **Update Firebase Config**:
   - Use production `google-services.json`
   - Update Barid dashboard environment variables

4. **Test on Multiple Devices**:
   - Test on different Android versions
   - Test with different notification settings
